Here’s your revised version—polished for clarity and flow, with grammar cleaned up, but keeping your conversational tone and personality intact. I've also added gentle transitions to smooth the pacing and make the structure feel cohesive while keeping your “real person figuring stuff out” energy. --- # My Journey Into the World of Split Keyboards I had a problem. After long workdays, my fingers and wrists would get sore—sometimes painfully so. I figured it was from all the typing. To help, I tried slowing down and typing more softly, hoping it would ease the strain outside of work. But my hobbies didn’t make things easier. I’m a forever Game Master *and* I program for fun. So saying I type triple the average number of words per day might actually be an understatement. Quitting typing isn’t an option—DM life and dev life both involve constant essays! So, I decided to dive into the world of ergonomic split keyboards. 😄 ## The First Experiment My doctor recommended hand stretches and proper hand placement. That helped a lot with my wrist pain—now, it only flares up every few months. But my fingers? Still not happy. That’s when I started researching ergonomic keyboards. And that’s a rabbit hole, my friend. ## Why Did I Decide to Get an Ergonomic Keyboard? - I have RSI issues that flare up in my wrists and fingers, sometimes making them painful or even unusable. - I’m a sucker for trying new gear, even if it comes with a learning curve. ## Why Split Keyboards Help with Ergonomics Try this: sit at your desk and rest your hands on your keyboard’s home row. Your left index finger should be on the **F** key and your right on the **J**. Now, notice how your hands feel. Are they relaxed and natural, like when they rest at your sides? Or do they feel twisted and tensed? Probably the latter. That’s thanks to the design of traditional keyboards—a design that hasn’t changed much since the typewriter era. The staggered row layout (yep, that weird offset between keys) was originally engineered to keep the mechanical arms on typewriters from jamming into each other. We’ve clung to that layout ever since, even though modern keyboards don’t *need* it. Split keyboards challenge that holdover and let us type in a way that actually fits human anatomy. ## What Makes a Split Keyboard Special? ### Being Split The main advantage, of course, is—you guessed it—being split. You can position each half wherever feels best for your body. No more forcing your shoulders and wrists into awkward angles. - **Decreases ulnar deviation:** less outward wrist bending. - **Allows splay:** you can rotate the halves slightly outwards, so they align more naturally with your arms. ### The Legendary Tilt Ever notice how resting your hands flat on the desk for hours tires them out? That’s because it restricts blood flow in your forearms. Tenting or tilting your keyboard (even by just 30°) improves circulation and reduces fatigue. The result? More stamina for your marathon typing sessions. ### Layers If you’ve ever looked up split keyboards, you probably noticed that many have *fewer* keys—sometimes as few as 30! How does that even work? Simple: **layers**. Think of layers as modes for your keyboard. Switching layers changes the function of your keys. For example, I have a number layer—the keys on my left side transform into a number pad layout. My **C** key becomes “1,” **T** becomes “9,” and so on.

But for those of us who see the keyboard as more than a tool—it’s another playground for creativity. For example, I hate reaching for **Q**, **A**, **Z**, and **P**. I could just train my muscle memory… or I could reprogram them as “combo keys.” These keys only trigger when pressed with another key, saving me unnecessary motion and letting me remove more than 20 keys from my daily setup. Once you get into combos and layers, it feels like discovering scripting for the first time—you can’t believe how much power you suddenly have. --- ## Where Did I Start? After several weeks of research, I finally decided to take the plunge. I’m a big believer in learning by doing—trying something firsthand teaches me more than endless reading ever could. Here were my must-haves for my first split keyboard: - **Trackball:** so I don’t have to move my hands away from the keyboard. - **Tenting support:** for better wrist alignment. - **Hot-swappable switches:** I prefer heavier switches to prevent accidental presses. I ended up choosing the **Cckball-61**, paired with UGreen cellphone holders for DIY tenting. It’s a budget-friendly, 3D-printed board with a big trackball. Not the best option on the market, but absolutely solid for beginners. ## The Layout When I say “layout,” I’m talking about a few key parts: - Layers - Key assignments - Combos (I prefer these over home row mods) This part often gets overlooked in other blogs. Learning a layout isn’t hard—it just takes time, persistence, and a willingness to tweak things (sometimes endlessly). You’ll make a change, realize it affects something else, adjust, and maybe even revert a week later. It’s part of the process. I’m still fine-tuning mine, but I’m happy with my base layer, number layer, and symbol layer.

I’m definitely slower at typing and way slower when coding (ouch), but the payoff is worth it. My finger pain is *completely gone*, and my wrist pain only reappears if I use my old mechanical keyboard too much. I don’t see myself going back—especially once my next split keyboard arrives. --- That’s the story so far. From sore wrists to fully-customized split keyboards, the difference has been night and day. Typing feels more like a craft now—a mix of design, comfort, and experimentation. And honestly, that’s half the fun.
