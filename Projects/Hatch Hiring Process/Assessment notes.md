- I create an index for conversations and partipants  to improve performance since new messages will be added to existing conversations
- I added a participant_key to the conversation table to allow me to check for uniqueness while staying lean for the take home project. I wanted to create a join table of conversations and participants. Creating a very clear relationship between the two entities. 
- 
- [ ] Write up an architecture.md or docs/decisions.md to help make some of my decisions clear 
- [ ] Put_participant_key: 
	- [ ] I decided to use a canonical key pattern for ease and simplicity. By combining the two participants numbers into a single string, this allows the application to confirm uniqueness while keeping the database layer lean. For this project, speed has priority but prod project, I would push for a foreign key/join table implementation.
- [ ] Next step: Create a http client using mimic that returns mocked http responses
