## Requirements
Unified Messaging API: HTTP endpoints to send and receive messages from both SMS/MMS and Email Providers.
	- Support sending messages through the appropriate provider based on message type
	- Handle incoming webhook messages from both providers
Conversation Management: Messages should be automatically grouped into conversations based on participants (from/to addresses)
Data Persistence: All conversations and messages must be stored in a relational database with proper relationships and indexing



## ðŸ§© In Practical Terms, Youâ€™ll Deliver

1. **HTTP Endpoints**
    
    - `/messages/send` â†’ Send outbound messages via SMS/MMS or Email.
    - `/webhooks/<provider>` â†’ Handle inbound webhooks from providers.
    - Possibly `/conversations` â†’ View or query message threads.
2. **Database**
    
    - Tables for `conversations`, `messages`, and maybe `participants`.
    - Relationship: one conversation â†’ many messages.
3. **Core Logic**
    
    - Detect or create conversation by participants.
    - Normalize inbound/outbound payloads to a unified schema.
    - Retry or handle provider errors gracefully.
4. **Operational Scripts**
    
    - Makefile + Docker Compose for consistent environment.
    - Test scripts validating correctness.



| Method | Route              | Purpose                                       |
| ------ | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | api/messages/send  | Send an outbound message via correct provider |
| POST   | api/webhooks/sms   | Receive inbound SMS/MMS                       |
| POST   | api/webhooks/email | Receive inbound email                         |
Each Controller would need:
- [ ] Accept JSON Payload #todo
- [ ] Validates via changeset #todo 
- [ ] Delegates logic to the relevant context #todo 
- [ ] Returns JSON response(200, 422, etc) #todo 

## ðŸ§° Development Flow (Using Phoenix + Docker + Make)
- [ ] Start Postgres #todo 
- [ ] `make run` -> launches Phoenix Server #todo 
- [ ] `make test` -> Runs ExUnit Suite (Unit + Integration) #todo 

Behind the secnes, your startup script `bin/start.sh` call call `Mix Ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate && Mix phx.server`
