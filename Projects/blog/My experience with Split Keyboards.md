I had a problem. After some of my longer work days, my fingers and waist would be swore. I figured it was from typing alot. So I would purposely slow down and soften my typing to help my hands outside of work. My hobbies didn't help. I'm a forever Game master and I program as a hobby. So to say, I triple the average number of words a person types in a day, would be a low estimate. Can't really stop typing as a dev and I'm a forever DM, so essays will remain a thing. I guess I can dive into to world of ergo split keyboards to five it (Smiling face). 

After trying some methods recommended by my doctor, hand stretches improved hand placement and technique. I improved my waist pain. I can say once every few months, they will become swore but waist weakness was a thing of the past. The finger pain remained an issue. That is when I decided to research ergonomic keyboards. 

When getting into split keyboards, I learned that there are many concepts you need to learn and understand. First, let me introduce you to the basic concepts then we can move to more advance ones later. 

### Why did I decided to get a egononmic keyboard?
- I have RSI that flares up in my waist and fingers. Ranging from pain similar to being swore to unusable. 
- Because I always want to try something new, even if it's harder to use. 


### Why does split keyboards help with ergonomic?

Let's try something. Sit down at your desk and put your hands on your home row of the key. Proper technique would require your left index finger to cover the 'F' key while your right covers the 'J'. The following can vary a bit depending on your keyboard, height of desk, etc but.... your hands. How comfortable are they? As comfortable as when they are to your side? When you are writing? Reading? Eating? Probably not. 
 
This is due to the keyboard. The layout of the keyboard has not changed since the typewriter times. The Row staggered layout using the qwerty. Instead of allowing ourselves to outgrow this old layout created because each key on a typewriter had a metal bar connected to it. This "level", when push down, would engage the pedal with ink to press against the page. We stick with this old style while othe alternatives are introduced and mature. 

## What makes a split keyboard special?
### Being Split
Splitting the keyboard has a few advantages but the main one, is allows the user to space the keyboards in a way that is most comfortable. It instead of enforcing very bad type habits. They enforce healthy alignment of your shoulders, waist and hands.
+Decrease Ulnar deviation(outwardly bent waist)
+Allows for splay, rotating the keyboards so the close edge is actually facing slightly away from you. Allowing for better waist health

### Legendary tilt 
If you haven't noticed, having your hand plan down against a table for long periods of time while performing hand oriented task wears them out. This fatigue is due to your forearms having reduce blood flow. Tilting the keyboard by 30 degrees allows blood to flow, reducing fatigue
+Increased Stamina when typing for longer hours

### Layers
If you have spent any time looking at split keyboards, you probably noticed that many of them do not have the "normal" amount of keys. Some kbs come with as little as 30 keys. This is possible by using *Layers*. Try to think of this as different modes for your keyboard. When you switch to a different mode, keys can give a different input. For instance, I have a number layer of my current keyboard. Instead of relying on a number pad, I assigned them to the keys on my left kb. I laid them out in the same format as a number pad. So my C is 1 and T is 9

### Custom Configuration 
Using a configuration software, you can change the output of your keys. For most people, you don't need this. Keep with the qwerty keyboard layout and the layers the kb comes with. 

But for people that keyboard is more than a tool? This will unlock so many does for you. I can only compare it to when I first discover scripting. 

For example, I hate how I have to reach for the Q,A,Z and P keys when typing. Now, I could just tough it out and allow my muscle memory help me "forget" that I'm reaching for these keys...... OR..
I could just program these keys to keys I can reach but they will out active when I'M pushing another key. These "Combos", was one of the reasons I took they 61 keys available on my kb and removed 21 of them for my daily use. I realized I didn't need 60. 




## Where did I Start?
After weeks of research on split keyboards, I collected a list of criteria to help me decide which one to try first. I a iterative type of person, I will gain 5x more information from trying something first compared to just researching it. S 

After weeks of research, I decided I was ready to pull the trigger on a keyboard to get my first iteration out of the way. I'm a pretty iterative/get my own hands dirty first type of person. I can learn 5x fast by simple trying out the new hobby, language, technology, etc compared to stay in the research mode for longer. 

I collected a list of criteria for the keyboard:
- Needs a trackball, I wanted to limit the amount my hands move from the keyboard
- Allows for tenting, for my waist
- Hotswappable key switches, I prefer heavy switches. This limits un-intended key pushes.

The keyboard I ended up trying was the Cckball-61 with UGreen Cell phone holds to act as tenting. I will post a review for th keyboard later but this was a cheaper, 3d print keyboard that I would recommend for first timers. This a far from the best of the cheaper options but this one was one of the few with a large trackball. 
## The Layout 

When I say layout, I'm referencing a few parts of the configuration of the kb. 
- Layers
- Key assignments
- Combos(I prefer combos over home row mods)

This is the part of learning to use a split kb that alot of blogs seem to leave out. Learning a layout, takes time but is not difficult. Creating and perfecting your layout, takes alot of trail and error. persistence And most of all, time. You are going to make a change to your layout that requires you to change a few other keys. Then next week, you switch back to your orignal layout because mod/tap keys wasn't it. 

I'm still changing mine but I'm pretty happy with my base layer(default layer mode), number layer and symbol layer.

## So far, so good
I'm 2 months in. I've gotten to a point that I use my split keyboard 90% of the time. I'm still slow at typing, even slower at coding. Which sucks but my finger pain has completely disappear and my waist pain only returns when I use my old mechanical keyboard too much. I don't see myself using the mechanical keyboard as my daily driver ever again. Especially when my new split keyboard arrives.

I had a problem. After long workdays, my fingers and wrists would get soreâ€”sometimes painfully so. I figured it was from all the typing. To help, I tried slowing down and typing more softly, hoping it would ease the strain outside of work.

But my hobbies didnâ€™t make things easier. Iâ€™m a forever Game Master _and_ I program for fun. So saying I type triple the average number of words per day might actually be an understatement. I can't just stop typing, I would be out of a job and my favorite hobby?? 
So, I decided to dive into the world of ergonomic split keyboards. ðŸ˜„

## The First Experiment
My doctor recommended hand stretches and proper hand placement. That helped a lot with my wrist painâ€”now, it only flares up every few months. But my fingers? Still not happy. Thatâ€™s when I started researching ergonomic keyboards.

Down the Rabbit Hole I go!

### Why Did I Decide to Get an Ergonomic Keyboard?

- I have RSI issues that flare up in my wrists and fingers, sometimes making them painful or even unusable.
- Iâ€™m a sucker for trying something new, even if it comes with a learning curve.

### Why Split keyboards help with Ergonomics
Try this: sit at your desk and rest your hands on your keyboardâ€™s home row. Your left index finger should be on the **F** key and your right on the **J**. Now, notice how your hands feel. Focus on your waist especially. 
Are they relaxed and natural, like when they rest at your sides? Or do they feel slightly twisted and tensed?
