I had a problem. After some of my longer work days, my fingers and waist would be swore. I figured it was from typing alot. So I would purposely slow down and soften my typing to help my hands outside of work. My hobbies didn't help. I'm a forever Game master and I program as a hobby. So to say, I triple the average number of words a person types in a day, would be a low estimate. Can't really stop typing as a dev and I'm a forever DM, so essays will remain a thing. I guess I can dive into to world of ergo split keyboards to five it (Smiling face). 

After trying some methods recommended by my doctor, hand stretches improved hand placement and technique. I improved my waist pain. I can say once every few months, they will become swore but waist weakness was a thing of the past. The finger pain remained an issue. That is when I decided to research ergonomic keyboards. 

When getting into split keyboards, I learned that there are many concepts you need to learn and understand. First, let me introduce you to the basic concepts then we can move to more advance ones later. 

### Why did I decided to get a egononmic keyboard?
- I have RSI that flares up in my waist and fingers. Ranging from pain similar to being swore to unusable. 
- Because I always want to try something new, even if it's harder to use. 


### Why does split keyboards help with ergonomic?

Let's try something. Sit down at your desk and put your hands on your home row of the key. Proper technique would require your left index finger to cover the 'F' key while your right covers the 'J'. The following can vary a bit depending on your keyboard, height of desk, etc but.... your hands. How comfortable are they? As comfortable as when they are to your side? When you are writing? Reading? Eating? Probably not. 
 
This is due to the keyboard. The layout of the keyboard has not changed since the typewriter times. The Row staggered layout using the qwerty. Instead of allowing ourselves to outgrow this old layout created because each key on a typewriter had a metal bar connected to it. This "level", when push down, would engage the pedal with ink to press against the page. We stick with this old style while othe alternatives are introduced and mature. 

## How do they work?
I'm just going to give a high level here. I suggest you do a quick google/youtube search if you want a deeper dive. Split keyboards can vary in design from having trackballs, 61 keys vs 30 or curved vs flat keywell. How they functions is mostly the same.

Since most does not have the same number of keyboards as large keyboards, they *_layer_* keys on the keyboard.

## Where did I Start?
After weeks of research on split keyboards, I collected a list of criteria to help me decide which one
