## Instruction

This is a small version of my personal note template for bullet journal taking. It contains about 10 frequently used third party templates.

- "1.Daily Log": a folder storing all daily notes
- "2.Weekly Log": a folder storing all weekly notes
- "3.Monthly Log": a folder storing all monthly notes
- "4.Future Log": a folder storing all future notes (future plans within 5 years)
- "5.Yearly Log": a folder storing all yearly results
- Excalidraw: a default place to store all notes in Excalidraw
- Projects: a folder to store all projects (based on the Project folder)
- Template: all markdown templates to generate notes
