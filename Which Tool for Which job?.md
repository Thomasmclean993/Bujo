| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Python** | Data science, Automation, Web dev, Scripting | Huge ecosystem, fast dev time, beginner-friendly     |
| **Go**     | Cloud infrastructure, APIs, Networking tools | Fast, concurrent, easy deployment, great for scale   |
| **Elixir** | Real-time, fault-tolerant systems            | Resilient, massively concurrent, functional elegance |

Python: Readable and quick development. Can focus on solving problems instead of syntax headarches
- Automation and scripting
- API and integration gule
- Tooling
- Machine learning and data science
Go: Build Fast, Go Fast.
- Cloud services
- High performance systems 
- Devops tooling
- APIs that need Speed
- **Blazing-fast compile times**
- **Built-in concurrency** via goroutines and channels
- **Static typing with straightforward syntax**
Elixir: Elixir runs on the **Erlang VM (BEAM)**, which was built decades ago for telecommunication systems that could never crash.
- Fault torerant
- Real time web applications
- Acalable APIs that never die
- - **Massive concurrency:** millions of lightweight processes
- **Resilience:** processes crash safely without taking your app down
- **Hot code upgrades:** deploy new code with zero downtime
