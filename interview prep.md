### background 
"I'm a software engineer with experience in designing and scaling enterprise-level healthcare solutions. My strongest language is Elixir and Phoenix, with production experience in Ruby on Rails and React. I'm play the role of implementation Engineer. I design, implement and test projects, usually owning most of the life cycle. 

A few examples of some projects are: 
Prior Authorization Status Checker microservice that scaled into a multimillion-dollar product generating over $5M in recurring monthly revenue. I also architected a universal integration engine that allows our application to integrate with multiple different apis and server up this data via our own api or in multiple UIs.

Beyond coding, I thrive when building reliable, scalable systems and guiding cross-functional teams to deliver high-impact solutions.

I don't just write software at work, it's also my hobby. 
- I have experience in Go, I've written a few side projects. Most notable, a project called mapture. A cli/tui interface that searches thry config files for keymaps. Presenting them in the terminal using fuzzy search functionality 

What motivates me most is not just writing solid software, but taking ownership of products end-to-endâ€”becoming someone the company can count on to move the needle both technically and strategically."

- My current focuses are mostly backend but every project requires me to extend or implement new components using React and most recently Liveview



## Why are you leaving cmm? 
For s few reasons: 
- I joined when the company had more of s start up culture. They have lost their competitive spirit 
- Working at the level that I am, the company can give me the pay or title that I'm currently working at. 
	- Designing and implementing 
	- Speaking with client/vendors during the lifecycle
	- Leading teams during implementation
Unfortunately, I have outgrown this company.
