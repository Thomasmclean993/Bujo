## Resume 
![[Thomas Resume RB.pdf]]

### background 
"I'm a software engineer with experience in designing and scaling enterprise-level healthcare solutions. My strongest technical background is in Elixir and Phoenix, with production expertise in Ruby on Rails and React. I led the development of a Prior Authorization Status Checker microservice that scaled into a multimillion-dollar product generating over $5M in recurring monthly revenue. I also architected a universal integration engine that replaced a costly third-party vendor, helping the company lower expenses while expanding capabilities.

Beyond coding, I thrive when building reliable, scalable systems and guiding cross-functional teams to deliver high-impact solutions. What motivates me most is not just writing solid software, but taking ownership of products end-to-endâ€”becoming someone the company can count on to move the needle both technically and strategically."

- My current focuses are mostly backend but every project requires me to extend or implement new components using React and most recently Liveview
- I have experience in Go, I've written a few side projects. Most notable, a project called mapture. A cli/tui interface that searches thry config files for keymaps. Presenting them in the terminal using fuzzy search functionality 


## Why are you leaving cmm? 
For s few reasons: 
- I joined when the company had more of s start up culture. They have lost their competitive spirit 
- Working at the level that I am, the company can give me the pay or title that I'm currently working at. 
	- Designing and implementing 
	- Speaking with client/vendors during the lifecycle
	- Leading teams during implementation
Unfortunately, I have outgrown this company.
